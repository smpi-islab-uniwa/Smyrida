Variants
++++++++

Each time a process runs, a trace is created that consist of a sequence of activities. Some sequences are repeated. Variants are the unique sequences of activities. In the figure of variants each activity is represented as a rectagle in different color (same color for same activity). This is a very important figure because the user can see the number, the length and the frequncy of each variant, but most important the pattern of variants.  
For example in this process each variant starts and ends with the same activity.

From menu **Visualizations** choose **Variants** under group Traces.
