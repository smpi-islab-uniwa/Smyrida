Activities Mean Duration
++++++++++++++++++++++++


Each activity has a duration, as it happens through time. Showing the mean duration of each activity, is valuable information, firstly, to explore which activity takes a lot of time to complete and secondly, to search for bottlenecks in the process and their cause.

Selecting **Activities Mean Duration** from menu **Visualizations** a bar plot is created with mean durations of each activity.
