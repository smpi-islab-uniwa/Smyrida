.. centered:: Smyrida - A Process Mining Software Tool

The name of the software was inspired by a stone mined mainly in the Greek island Naxos, which is suitable for the abrasion of glass and creation of asphalt due to its high stoniness and anti-slippery quality respectively. In the past years, mining smyrida contributed significantly to the establishment of a flourishing economy in the island.
